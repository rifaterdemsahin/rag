No, this script does not create an index on images. It exclusively indexes the textual content of markdown (.md) files.

How It Works
The script is designed for semantic text search, not image search. Here's a breakdown of the process:

Finds Markdown Files: It scans the specified folder for any file ending with the .md extension.

Extracts Text Only: The get_text_from_markdown function reads each markdown file and uses the MarkdownIt library to parse its content. Crucially, it only extracts content from tokens where token.type == 'inline'. This includes plain text, bold/italic text, and links, but it completely ignores image tags (![alt-text](image.png)), code blocks, and other non-text elements.

Creates Text Embeddings: It uses the SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2') model. This is a machine learning model specifically trained to convert sentences and paragraphs of text into numerical vectors (embeddings). It does not process images.

Builds a Search Index: The script then uses faiss to create a searchable index from these text embeddings. This allows for efficiently finding markdown files whose text is semantically similar to a search query.

In short, the script reads .md files, throws away everything that isn't text, converts the remaining text into vectors, and indexes those vectors. The image files themselves are never opened or analyzed.







which vector database and processing can i use both for text and image



Show thinking
You can use a multimodal vector database and a corresponding multimodal embedding model to handle both text and images. This approach allows you to represent both data types in the same vector space, making it possible to perform powerful similarity searches (e.g., finding images that match a text description or vice-versa).


Vector Databases
Most modern vector databases are "modality-agnostic," meaning they don't care if the vector represents text, an image, audio, or something else. They simply store and index the numerical vector data. The key is that the vectors for your text and images are generated by the same model and have the same number of dimensions.

Popular and effective choices include:

Milvus: An open-source vector database designed for high-performance similarity search at scale. It's highly flexible and widely used for multimodal applications.


Pinecone: A managed, cloud-native vector database that is easy to scale and use. It's a popular choice for developers who want to avoid managing infrastructure.

Weaviate: An open-source vector search engine with a graph-based data model. It offers features like semantic search and can even generate embeddings for you using integrated models.


Chroma DB: An open-source, "batteries-included" embedding database that is very easy to get started with, especially for in-application use with Python.

Vector Processing (Embedding Models)
The most critical part of a multimodal system is the embedding model, which converts your images and text into vectors. For your use case, you need a multimodal model that understands both domains.

The standout choice is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training), developed by OpenAI.

How CLIP Works 🧠
CLIP is trained on a massive dataset of image-text pairs from the internet. It learns to create a shared embedding space where the vector for an image is located very close to the vector for its corresponding text description.

Getty Images

For example, a photo of a golden retriever will produce a vector that is very similar to the vector for the text "a photo of a golden retriever." This allows for powerful "zero-shot" capabilities, where the model can identify objects and concepts in images without being explicitly trained on them.

Other Multimodal Models:

BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training): Another powerful model that excels at understanding image content and generating descriptive text.

Sentence-BERT + Image Models: You can use separate models for text (like Sentence-BERT) and images (like ResNet) and then use techniques to align their vector spaces, although this is more complex than using an end-to-end model like CLIP.

Example Workflow
Here’s a simplified step-by-step process for how you would implement this:

Choose a Model: Select a pre-trained multimodal model like CLIP.

Generate Embeddings:

For Images: Feed your image files through the CLIP model to get image embeddings (vectors).

For Text: Feed your text descriptions, captions, or documents through the same CLIP model to get text embeddings.

Choose a Database: Select a vector database like Milvus or Pinecone.

Index the Vectors: Store all the generated vectors (both image and text) in your chosen vector database. You should also store metadata alongside each vector, such as the file path for an image or the original text string.

Perform Searches:

Text-to-Image Search: Convert a new text query into a vector using CLIP and use it to search the database for the most similar image vectors.

Image-to-Image Search: Convert a new image into a vector using CLIP and search for the most similar image vectors.

Image-to-Text Search: Use an image vector to find the most relevant text descriptions in your database.






rewrite the script for BERT



Show thinking
Of course. Here is the script rewritten to use a BERT-based model for generating the embeddings.

The core logic remains the same, but the SentenceTransformer model has been changed from 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' to 'bert-base-nli-mean-tokens', which is a model that uses BERT to create sentence embeddings.

Python

import os
import argparse
import numpy as np
import faiss
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from markdown_it import MarkdownIt

def get_text_from_markdown(file_path):
    """Reads a markdown file and returns its text content."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            md = MarkdownIt()
            content = f.read()
            tokens = md.parse(content)
            # Extracts text from 'inline' tokens, which contain the main content
            text_content = " ".join([token.content for token in tokens if token.type == 'inline'])
            return text_content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading or parsing {file_path}: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Index markdown files for semantic search using BERT.")
    parser.add_argument('--folder', type=str, required=True, help="Folder containing markdown files to index.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    folder_path = args.folder
    if not os.path.isdir(folder_path):
        print(f"Error: Folder not found at {folder_path}")
        return

    print("Loading BERT-based sentence transformer model...")
    # --- MODEL CHANGE HERE ---
    # Swapped 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for a BERT-based model.
    # This model uses the output of a pre-trained BERT to generate embeddings.
    model = SentenceTransformer('bert-base-nli-mean-tokens')

    filepaths = []
    texts = []

    print(f"Scanning for markdown files in '{folder_path}'...")
    for root, _, files in os.walk(folder_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.md'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                text = get_text_from_markdown(file_path)
                if text:
                    filepaths.append(file_path)
                    texts.append(text)

    if not texts:
        print("No markdown files found or processed.")
        return

    print(f"Found {len(texts)} markdown files. Creating embeddings with BERT...")
    # The model.encode() function works the same way regardless of the underlying model
    embeddings = model.encode(texts, show_progress_bar=True, convert_to_tensor=False)
    embeddings = np.array(embeddings).astype('float32')
    
    # Get the embedding dimension from the model output
    dimension = embeddings.shape[1]
    
    # Create a FAISS index
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
    index = faiss.IndexIDMap(index)
    
    # Add vectors to the index with their corresponding IDs
    ids = np.array(range(len(filepaths)))
    index.add_with_ids(embeddings, ids)

    print("Saving FAISS index to 'faiss_index_bert.bin'...")
    faiss.write_index(index, 'faiss_index_bert.bin')
    
    print("Saving file paths to 'filepaths_bert.txt'...")
    with open('filepaths_bert.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for path in filepaths:
            f.write(f"{path}\n")
            
    print("Indexing complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Summary of Changes
Model Name: The only significant change is on the line where the SentenceTransformer is loaded. It now uses 'bert-base-nli-mean-tokens' instead of 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'.

Output Filenames: I've changed the output filenames to faiss_index_bert.bin and filepaths_bert.txt to avoid overwriting the index created by the original script.

Progress Bar: Added show_progress_bar=True to the model.encode() call, which is helpful as BERT models can be slower than MiniLM.

The rest of the script, including how FAISS creates the index and how files are read, remains identical because the sentence-transformers library provides a consistent interface for any model loaded through it.







in take the images as well with CLIP



Show thinking
Of course. Here is the script modified to use the CLIP model, which can process and index both text from markdown files and images in the same vector space.

This new script scans for markdown files and common image files (.png, .jpg, etc.). It then uses CLIP to create a unified set of vector embeddings for all of them, allowing you to search for images using text, find text using an image, and more.

Key Changes and How It Works
Multimodal Model: The script now loads 'clip-ViT-B-32', a pretrained CLIP model that understands the relationship between text and images.

PIL for Images: It uses the Pillow library (PIL) to open image files.

Combined File Scanning: The file scanning loop now checks for both markdown files and files with common image extensions (.png, .jpg, etc.).

Unified Data List: A single list, data_to_encode, holds all the items to be processed. For markdown files, it stores the extracted text string. For image files, it stores the PIL.Image object.

Unified Encoding: The sentence-transformers library is powerful enough that its model.encode() method can accept a mixed list of strings and PIL.Image objects. It automatically uses the correct part of the CLIP model for each item, producing vectors that all exist in the same vector space.


Shutterstock
Single Index: All the resulting embeddings, whether from text or images, are stored in a single FAISS index. This is what allows you to search across modalities. The filepaths_clip.txt file now maps an index ID to either a markdown file or an image file.







when i search for DOG would it find the images and text DOG



Show thinking
Yes, absolutely. When you search for "DOG", the system you've built will find both images of dogs and text files that mention the word "DOG".

This is the core strength of using the CLIP model.

How It Works 🗺️
Think of CLIP as creating a giant, "smart map" where it places everything it understands. This map is the shared vector space.

Encoding Your Search: When you search for "DOG", CLIP converts this word into a specific coordinate (a vector) on the map.

A Shared Space for Meaning: CLIP is trained to understand that the concept of a dog in a picture is the same as the word "dog" in a sentence. Therefore, it places the vectors for dog images very close to the vectors for text about dogs.

Finding the Closest Neighbors: The search process uses your query vector ("DOG") and asks the FAISS index to find the vectors on the map that are closest to it. Because both types of content are in the same neighborhood, you get both in your results.

What You Would Find
Your search results would include a ranked list of the most relevant items, such as:

Images: Files like golden_retriever.jpg, poodle.png, or german_shepherd.webp would rank highly.

Text Files: Markdown files like my_pets.md that contain sentences such as "I have a dog named Sparky" would also be returned.

This powerful ability to connect and search across different types of media (text and images) is what makes multimodal systems so effective. 🐾
