# rag

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — a paradigm that combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) so model outputs are grounded in external sources.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a structured approach to building projects with RAG principles in mind. It organizes work into seven focused folders representing stages of a development lifecycle — from defining goals to validating outcomes.

## Project Structure

This project uses a seven-folder structure representing a holistic development journey. Each folder has a specific purpose and guides a structured workflow.

- `1_Real` — Objectives & Key Results
  - Premise: Every project must begin with a clear, measurable goal.
  - Content: High-level objectives and key results (OKRs).
  - Purpose: Keep work aligned with tangible outcomes.

- `2_Environment` — Roadmap & Use Cases
  - Premise: Goals need a path.
  - Content: Project roadmap, milestones, learning modules, and real-world use cases.
  - Purpose: Provide strategic direction and user-focused context.

- `3_UI` — Knowledge & Skill Acquisition
  - Premise: Development is a continuous learning journey.
  - Content: Personal knowledge base for concepts, theories, design patterns, and skills.
  - Purpose: Encourage growth and document key learnings.

- `4_Formula` — Guides & Best Practices
  - Premise: Reuse proven solutions where appropriate.
  - Content: Templates, coding patterns, style guides, and helpful snippets.
  - Purpose: Improve consistency and speed of delivery.

- `5_Symbols` — Implementation & Code
  - Premise: Where design and theory become working software.
  - Content: Core application source code (Vite + React) and implementation artifacts.
  - Purpose: Contains the runnable project and main codebase.

- `6_Semblance` — Error Logging & Solutions
  - Premise: Bugs are opportunities to learn.
  - Content: Logs of errors, root causes, and resolutions.
  - Purpose: Reduce repeated mistakes and accelerate debugging.

- `7_Testing` — Validation & Quality Assurance
  - Premise: A project is complete only when validated.
  - Content: Tests, QA documentation, and validation scripts.
  - Purpose: Ensure quality and verify objectives are met.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start in `1_Real` to understand the goals and success criteria.
2. Consult `2_Environment` for the roadmap and use cases to plan work.
3. Use `3_UI` and `4_Formula` for learning resources and coding standards.
4. Implement features in `5_Symbols`.
5. Record and learn from errors in `6_Semblance`.
6. Write and run tests in `7_Testing` to validate changes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. When contributing:
- Open issues to discuss large changes.
- Follow the guides in `4_Formula` for coding style and PR structure.
- Add tests to `7_Testing` for any functionality you change or add.
