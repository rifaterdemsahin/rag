# Fundamentals of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.

## Key Concepts

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized individuals.
- **Integrity:** Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that systems, applications, and data are available to users when they need them.
- **Threat Mitigation:** Implementing security measures to reduce the risk of cyber attacks.
