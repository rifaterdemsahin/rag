# Understanding DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

## Core Principles

- **Automation:** Automating the software development lifecycle, from build to deployment.
- **Collaboration:** Fostering a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** A practice of frequently integrating code changes and automatically delivering them to production.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring the performance of the application and the underlying infrastructure.
