# Understanding Databases

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

## Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases:** Data is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
- **NoSQL Databases:** These databases do not use the tabular schema of relational databases. They are often used for big data and real-time web apps. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.
