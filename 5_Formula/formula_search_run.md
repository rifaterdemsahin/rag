# Search Execution and Explanation

This document details the execution of the `search.py` script and provides a step-by-step explanation of how the search process works.

## 1. Command Execution

After adding the `mehmet.md` file and re-running the indexer, we can now search for content related to "mehmet".

```bash
python3 search.py --query "who is mehmet"
```

## 2. Search Output

The script successfully finds the new document as the most relevant result.

```text
Loading FAISS index from 'faiss_index.bin'...
Loading file paths from 'filepaths.txt'...
Loading sentence transformer model...
Searching for: 'who is mehmet'

Top 5 search results:
1. ./docs/mehmet.md (Distance: 1.2084)
2. ./docs/databases.md (Distance: 1.8730)
3. ./docs/version_control.md (Distance: 1.9212)
4. ./docs/devops.md (Distance: 1.9443)
5. ./docs/cybersecurity.md (Distance: 1.9989)
```

## 3. Step-by-Step Explanation

The `search.py` script follows a precise sequence to find relevant documents for a given query.

1.  **Load Pre-built Data**: The script begins by loading the `faiss_index.bin` file, which contains all the vector embeddings, and the `filepaths.txt` file, which maps each vector back to its original markdown file.

2.  **Load the Language Model**: It loads the exact same `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model that was used during the indexing phase. This consistency is critical for ensuring that the query vector is in the same "semantic space" as the document vectors.

3.  **Vectorize the User Query**: The user's query string (e.g., "who is mehmet") is passed to the loaded model. The model converts this text into a 384-dimension vector embedding that represents its semantic meaning.

4.  **Perform the Similarity Search**: The script uses the FAISS `index.search()` function. It takes the query vector and searches the entire index to find the 5 vectors that are "closest" to it. The closeness is measured by L2 (Euclidean) distance, where a smaller distance means a better match.

5.  **Retrieve and Display Results**: The search returns the indices (or IDs) of the top 5 matching vectors and their corresponding distances. The script uses these indices to look up the file paths from the `filepaths` list that was loaded in step 1. Finally, it prints the ranked list of file paths and their distances to the user.
