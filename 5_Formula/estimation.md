```

**Deliverable:** Working vector search that returns similar posts

---

### Task 3: n8n Workflow Foundation (90 minutes)
**Priority: HIGH**

Create 3 core workflows:

#### Workflow 1: Content Generation Trigger

- [ ] Decision node (approve/reject)
- [ ] Store decision in database
- [ ] Send confirmation message

#### Workflow 3: LinkedIn Publisher
- [ ] Schedule trigger or manual trigger
- [ ] Get approved posts
- [ ] LinkedIn API node
- [ ] Post content
- [ ] Update status

**Deliverable:** 3 working n8n workflows (can test locally)

---

## 🍔 LUNCH BREAK (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)

**Checkpoint Questions:**
- Is Faiss returning relevant results?
- Are n8n workflows triggering correctly?
- Any blockers to resolve after lunch?

---

## ☀️ PHASE 2: Afternoon Session (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Task 4: RAG System Integration (2 hours)

**Key Script:**
```python
# rag_system.py
def generate_content(topic, user_voice_examples):
    # 1. Search Faiss for relevant posts
    # 2. Build context from top 3-5 results
    # 3. Create prompt with context
    # 4. Call OpenAI API
    # 5. Return generated content + metadata
```

**Deliverable:** Python API endpoint that generates authentic content

---

### Task 5: Frontend Dashboard Refinement (90 minutes)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] Connect frontend to n8n webhooks
- [ ] Implement real API calls (replace mock data)
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Test user flow: Generate → Review → Approve
- [ ] Style polish and responsive design
- [ ] Add configuration persistence

**Deliverable:** Functional dashboard that calls real APIs

**Priority: MEDIUM** (Can be mocked for MVP)

- [ ] Get LinkedIn API credentials
- [ ] Set up OAuth flow (or use existing token)
- [ ] Test post creation via API
- [ ] Add to n8n workflow
- [ ] Test full publish flow

**Alternative:** If LinkedIn API is complex, mock this for MVP and manually copy/paste

**Deliverable:** Ability to post to LinkedIn (automated or semi-automated)

---

### Task 8: GitHub Pages Deployment (45 minutes)
**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Create production build of frontend
- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Test deployment
- [ ] Set up environment variables

**Files Structure:**
```
linkedin-content-magician/
├── index.html (dashboard)
├── vector_db/
│   ├── index_content.py
│   └── search_content.py
├── n8n_workflows/
│   ├── content_generation.json
│   ├── telegram_approval.json
│   └── linkedin_publisher.json
├── README.md
└── docs/
    └── SETUP_GUIDE.md
```
