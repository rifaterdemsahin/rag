# Project Goals: Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

This document outlines the high-level objectives and the measurable key results for the Markdown Semantic Search project.

## Objective

**To create a simple, efficient, and standalone tool that enables powerful semantic search over a local collection of markdown documents.**

The goal is to provide a user with the ability to find relevant information based on the conceptual meaning of their queries, rather than being limited to simple keyword matching, without relying on external services.

## Key Results

Here are the key results that measure the successful achievement of the project's objective:

1.  **KR1: Fully Functional Indexing Pipeline**
    -   **Metric:** The system can successfully process a directory of at least 10 markdown files, generating a single, searchable vector index file (`faiss_index.bin`) and a corresponding file path map (`filepaths.txt`).
    -   **Status:** **Achieved**.

2.  **KR2: Effective Semantic Search Capability**
    -   **Metric:** For a given conceptual query (e.g., "understanding user intent"), the search tool returns the most contextually relevant markdown document as the top result with a similarity score better than random chance.
    -   **Status:** **Achieved**. The tool successfully identifies `docs/sample.md` when queried about "what is semantic search".

3.  **KR3: Clear and Comprehensive Documentation**
    -   **Metric:** The project contains clear, step-by-step instructions for setup (`USAGE.md`), a high-level architectural overview (`architecture.md`), and a project description (`cline.md`) that allows a new user to understand, set up, and use the tool without needing additional guidance.
    -   **Status:** **Achieved**.

4.  **KR4: Environment and Dependency Management**
    -   **Metric:** The project is configured to use a Python virtual environment, and all dependencies are explicitly listed in `requirements.txt`. A `.gitignore` file is in place to exclude environment-specific and generated files from version control.
    -   **Status:** **Achieved**.
