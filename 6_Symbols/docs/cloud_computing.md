# Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## Cloud Service Models

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Provides software applications over the internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis.
