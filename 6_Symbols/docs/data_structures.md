# Fundamental Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

## Common Data Structures

- **Arrays:** A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists:** A linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
- **Stacks:** A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues:** A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Trees:** A hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
- **Graphs:** A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
