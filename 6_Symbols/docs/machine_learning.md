# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

## Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each data point is tagged with the correct output.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm works with unlabeled data to find patterns or structures on its own.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.
