# Principles of API Design

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Good API design is crucial for building scalable and maintainable systems.

## Key Principles

- **Simplicity:** The API should be easy to learn and use.
- **Consistency:** The API should use a consistent naming convention and data format.
- **Flexibility:** The API should be able to evolve over time without breaking existing clients.
- **Good Documentation:** The API should be well-documented with clear examples.
