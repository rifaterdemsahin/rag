# Introduction to Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, and see who last modified something that might be causing a problem.

## Git

Git is the most popular distributed version control system. Git provides strong support for non-linear development, allowing multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.
